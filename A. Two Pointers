Given two pointers ptr1 and ptr2. Write piece of code which lets them to point at the same place the memory.
You may assume that somewhere above in the same block are declared two pointers ptr1 and ptr2 of type int *, pointing at the some allocated variables in the local memory of your program.
Your piece of code should not contain any function deÔ¨Ånitions (including main). You are not allowed to perform the input/output in your piece of code.
